:warning: **As of February, 2022, we are putting this repo on hold and will not be investing in further improvements to it.** :warning:

This is because:

- Maintaining the code for a complicated, distributed, stateful system like Couchbase is very time consuming.
- Weâ€™ve had very little customer usage / interest in a self-managed Couchbase offering, so it does not make sense to continue to make a large investment in it.

Therefore, for the time being, if you need to use Couchbase, we strongly recommend using one of the following alternatives:

- [Couchbase in AWS marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=1a064a14-5ac2-4980-9167-15746aabde72)
- [Couchbase Capella](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/index.html)

# Couchbase AWS Module

[![Maintained by Gruntwork.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-gruntwork.io-%235849a6.svg)](https://gruntwork.io/?ref=repo_aws_couchbase)
![Terraform Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/tf-%3E%3D0.15.0-blue.svg)

This repo contains a set of modules for deploying [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) on 
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Packer](https://www.packer.io/). 
Couchbase is a distributed NoSQL document database. This module supports running Couchbase as a single cluster:

![Couchbase single-cluster architecture](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase/blob/main/_docs/couchbase-single-cluster-architecture.png?raw=true)

Or as multiple clusters for the various Couchbase services (data, management, search, index, query) and Sync Gateway:

![Couchbase multi-cluster architecture](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase/blob/main/_docs/couchbase-multi-cluster-architecture.png?raw=true)




## Features

* Deploy Couchbase and Sync Gateway.
* Automatic bootstrapping.
* Cross-region replication
* Multi-dimensional scaling, allowing you to separately scale data, management, search, index, query, and Sync 
  Gateway nodes.
* Auto healing.
* Web console UI.




## Learn

This repo is maintained by [Gruntwork](https://www.gruntwork.io), and follows the same patterns as [the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/), a collection of reusable,
battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. You can read [How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library](https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/) for an overview
of how to use modules maintained by Gruntwork!

### Core concepts

  guides for administrators, developers, SQL developers, and mobile developers.
* [Couchbase tutorials](https://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/index.html): hands-on guides for getting started with
  Couchbase.
* [Couchbase Security](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/6.0/learn/security/security-overview.html): overview of how to 
  secure your Couchbase clusters.


### Repo organization

Check out [How to use this repo](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase/tree/main/core-concepts.md#how-to-use-this-repo): 
for an overview.

* [modules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase/tree/main/modules): the main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
* [examples](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase/tree/main/examples): This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* [test](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase/tree/main/test): Automated tests for the modules and examples.
* [root](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase/tree/main): The root folder is *an example* of how to use the submodules to deploy a Couchbase cluster. The Terraform Registry requires the root of every repo to contain Terraform code, so we've put one of the examples there. This example is great for learning and experimenting, but for production use, please use the underlying modules in the [modules folder](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase/tree/main/modules) directly.
